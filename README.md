# 🐾 Paw Control – Android Arcade Game

Paw Control is a fast-paced 2D arcade survival game built from scratch using **Java and Android Studio**.  
The project started as an exploration of **game development in Android Studio** and gradually evolved into a fully functional custom-rendered Android game.

## 🎮 About the Game

In Paw Control, the player controls **Doggo 🐶**, dodging falling spikes, collecting bones, and surviving as long as possible.  
The game focuses on **smooth gameplay**, **consistent UI across devices**, and **efficient performance**, without using any external game engine.
