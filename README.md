# 🐾 Paw Control – Android Arcade Game

Paw Control is a fast-paced 2D arcade survival game built from scratch using **Java and Android Studio**.  
The project started as an exploration of **game development in Android Studio** and gradually evolved into a fully functional custom-rendered Android game.
